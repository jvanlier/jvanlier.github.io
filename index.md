All-round senior Machine Learning Engineer that enjoys solving business problems with data.

Currently available for a new freelance project!

As a strong problem solver with attention to detail, I can help you tackle loosely defined data problems. I am able to drive projects to completion with minimal guidance, while at the same I go out of my way to involve stakeholders and mentor and educate colleagues.

My experience revolves around Python, Spark, Keras, TensorFlow, Machine Learning, Deep Learning-based Computer Vision and Airflow. I usually find myself on the intersection of data science and engineering, but happy to focus solely on either for a while.
