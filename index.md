I answer business questions using data science. My speciality is machine learning. 
I can rapidly create proof-of-concepts and experiments, but am just as happy to put in the engineering effort to 
deploy an analysis or model to production at scale. 

I am deeply familiar with the Python data ecosystem and have a lot of experience with distributed systems such as 
Hadoop, Hive, Storm and Spark.

I function well in a senior role, in which I can mentor and support junior data scientists and leverage 
my experience to make the big decisions, as long as I still get to do hands-on data science work myself as 
well. 

I'm always curious and strive to learn something new every day.
