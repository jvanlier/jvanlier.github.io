I am a freelance data scientist. I solve real business problems using data by applying innovative techniques such as machine learning, deep learning and computational statistics. Next to that I maintain a deep understanding of distributed systems and am more than happy to put in the engineering effort to deploy an analysis or model to production at scale. I am comfortable in a senior role, defining tasks, priorities and coaching junior teammates, but still love to dive into datasets myself as well. I'm always curious and always strive to learn something new. 

A bit of history: I received an MSc in Computer Science from Leiden University (in The Netherlands) and then joined KPMG in 2010. Initially as an IT consultant doing business intelligence and data quality projects, but as soon as "Big Data" became a thing I knew that was what I wanted to do. Luckily, around the same time a Big Data team started within KPMG. I joined them late 2013 to do Big Data projects for clients and to help develop a Location Analytics product called [BlueSense](http://bluesense.io/). I started doing a roughly 50/50 mix of data engineering/science work, but became fully responsible for analytics in the BlueSense team in 2016. In August 2017 I decided to continue my career as a freelance data scientist. 

Current status: available as of October 2nd, 2017!
