All-round engineer that enjoys solving business problems with data. I usually find myself on the intersection between data science and engineering, but happy to focus solely on either. 

Current focus is Data Engineering, MLOps, Deep Learning-based Computer Vision (Keras/TensorFlow), Python, Scala, Airflow, MLflow, Spark, CI/CD (Jenkins/GitLab CI), Docker, GCP.
