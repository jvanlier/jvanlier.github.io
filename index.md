I create business value using data science and machine learning. I like to build data products that help people make important decisions. I'm highly proficient with Python, Hadoop and Spark. As a team player with 7 years of professional experience, I function well in a senior role in a team, where I can take up a bit of project management and mentor junior data scientists. 

Accomplishments:
- marketing: customer segmentation
- predictive maintenance: anomaly detection, predicting which part might break (including probability) in metro and tram vehicles
- building an end-to-end IoT big data platform (lambda architecture)
- understanding crowd movements in indoor locations as measured by noisy sensors: density distribution approximations (heatmaps, flowmaps), walking path reconstruction, dwelltimes, calibrated visitor counts, Kalman filtering
- network science: recognizing teams within a company based solely on noisy Wi-Fi device data; quantifying collaboration between teams
- time series prediction: predicting future highway traffic, predicting future office capacity requirements, short term (30 minute) visitor predictions in a restaurant

<br/>**Current status: available for 4 days a week as of October 2nd, 2017!** I mainly operate in the region Amsterdam - Leiden - The Hague - Rotterdam - Utrecht in the Netherlands (in other words: the Randstad).
