I create business value using data science and machine learning. I enjoy building data products with some sort of predictive element to help people make important decisions. I'm highly proficient with Python, Hadoop and Spark. As a team player with 7 years of professional experience, I function well in a senior role in a team, where I can take up a bit of project management and mentor junior data scientists.
