Jori builds AI products that work. He doesn't stop when the proof of concept is done, and instead gladly continues to ship a sustainable product to end users. Because that's when AI can start making an impact and help people make data-driven decisions. 

Jori is an all-round senior data scientist with strong (machine learning) engineering skills. He possesses a lot of recent knowledge on deep learning (in particular for computer vision tasks, i.e. convolutional neural networks), but nevertheless appreciates the simplicity of linear models and recognizes when they suffice. With more than 9 years of professional experience, he is able to take on a senior or lead role in any team, guiding and mentoring junior data scientists. He also provides training sessions and workshops on request.
