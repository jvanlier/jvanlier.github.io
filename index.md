Hello, I am Jori.

I am a freelance data scientist with a never-ending curiosity. My speciality is machine learning: I am familiar with a wide range of techniques to explore datasets and to build predictive models. Next to that I have a strong foundation in engineering and distributed real-time systems. I'm more than happy to put in the engineering effort to deploy an analysis or model to production at scale. I am comfortable in a senior role, defining tasks, priorities and coaching junior teammates, but still love to dive into datasets myself as well.


A bit of history: I received an MSc in Computer Science from Leiden University (in NL) and then started working at KPMG in 2010. Initially as an IT consultant doing business intelligence and data quality projects, but soon enough I felt the urge to start tackling more complicated projects. Luckily, around the same time a Big Data team started within KPMG. I joined them late 2013 to do a mix of Big Data projects for clients and to help develop a Location Analytics product called [BlueSense](http://bluesense.io/). I started doing a roughly 50/50 mix of data engineering/science work, but became fully responsible for analytics in the BlueSense team in 2016. In August 2017 I decided continue my career as a freelance data scientist. 

Toolbox: Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, pycm3, keras, flask), Java, JS, Hadoop (Hortonworks mainly), Hive, YARN, HDFS, Spark, Storm, Kafka, Docker, *nix systems, SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB. But I’m always willing to learn something new.
