I create business value using data science. I have an all-round profile with a deep specialization in machine learning. My experience gives me the ability to pick up many different roles in projects. I'm known for my capability to rapidly churn out proof-of-concepts and experiments. The engineer in me is just as happy to deploy an analysis or model to production at scale with high quality code. I tend to combine these activities with a bit of project management and usually take on a senior / lead role in a team. In each case, I find it important to build things that people actually want to use and proactively seek out stakeholders to discuss approaches and results. 

I'm genuinely curious and strive to learn something new every day. I'm persistent and I take great pride in coming up with creative solutions to difficult problems.

Keywords that describe my profile: Big Data, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, pycm3, keras, flask), Java, JavaScript, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, Hive, SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, NodeJS, Linux, Git.
