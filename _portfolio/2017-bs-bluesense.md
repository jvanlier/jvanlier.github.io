[BlueSense][bs-website] measures the behaviour of people within buildings, in real-time, using a multitude of sensors. It includes state of the art analytics to understand crowd density, crowd movement patterns, dwell times and occupancy levels, both descriptive and predictive. This system was deployed at various clients in retail, public transport, facility management and a football stadium.

This was my main project during my time in the Big Data & Analytics team at KPMG. I started out doing mostly engineering and gradually transitioned into fulltime analytics as of October 2016. However, if you're in a small startup-scale team, you can't just focus on one thing alone. Other stuff has to be done as well. This has given me broad experience in: configuring sensors, installing sensors (in crazy locations such as subway stations), creating data acquisition software, ingesting data in real-time on a Hadoop platform, working with a Trusted Third Party to create a privacy-by-design system, an opt-out facility, designing a big data cluster architecture based on the lambda architecture, installing and configuring that cluster, building production-grade analysis code, building an analysis framework for Spark, prototyping a frontend dashboard, managing an external frontend developer, prototyping an indoor navigation app, building a visitor prediction app for the KPMG restaurant, cluster operations, being part of the management team, talking to customers (i.e. requirements engineering), aligning with corporate privacy- and security officers, making commercial and HR decisions, etc. It's an amazing and sometimes nerve-wrecking experience.

BlueSense has been incubating within KPMG NL from early 2014 until June 2017. A spin-off is in the works. I plan to be involved in that as well (1 day a week initially).
