Hello! I am a data scientist at KPMG. I like to help my clients tackle their machine learning problems and periodically post here when I run into something interesting or exciting. 

Meanwhile, I am in the process of launching a start-up called [BlueSense](http://bluesense.io), which aims to optimize workplaces by measuring and analyzing all sorts of sensor data. Me and my co-founders started with the realization that a lot of money can be saved by continously measuring workplace occupancy. These measurements result in all sorts of useful insights, based on which decisions can be made to stop renting and/or exploiting parts of an office building. But more importantly, it enables optimalizations of team to space allocations, predictions of future capacity requirements, measurements of collaboration across teams and things like predictive cleaning. 

Other than being a data geek I enjoy skiing, running, swimming, reading, and training my pet cockatoo.
