Proof-of-Concept Android app for indoor navigation, using a combination of signals from Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and the device's accelerometer data.

I developed the real-time data acquisition (20 beacons in close proximity operating at 20 Hz), the database connectivity, the graphical interface showing the user's location, an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path finding, proximity-triggered messaging and a Python/Django-based backend.
