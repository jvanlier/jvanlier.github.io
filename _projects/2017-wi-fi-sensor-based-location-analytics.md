I was part of a team that developed a system to measure the presence of Wi-Fi radios using custom Wi-Fi sensors. In essence, this enables insight into the approximate number of people in an area, how long they remain there, which route they take, how often they come back, etc. This system was deployed at various clients in retail, public transport, facility management and a football stadium.

I started out on the Data Engineering side and gradually transitioned into Data Science. 

My engineering contributions:
- Designing, implementing and maintaining a lambda-architecture based big data platform. 
- Developing streaming data processing code and real-time summary statistics in Apache Storm (Java).
- A framework to greatly simplfy PySpark-based batch jobs. Also, scheduling and monitoring them.
- Privacy by design: developed the anonymization pipeline involving a Trusted Third Party, and developed an opt-out system.
- Built a Python/Flask/MongoDB/jQuery/Bootstrap based configuration management tool to simplify the administration of sensor locations, regions, maps, geometry, etc. This saved many hours of work.
- Supervising Junior Data Engineers. 

Science:
- Developing a real-time Crowd Monitor for the KPMG Restaurant, with a short-term prediction (30 mins ahead). This was beneficial for internal marketing and helped our colleagues avoid crowds and queues. 
- Analyzing data from 120 sensors in a large furniture store, working together with stakeholders to extract useful insights in shopper's behavior.
- Pivoting the product into a version for workplace utilization and occupancy monitoring, in order to more efficiently allocate teams to areas, and possibly close down an entire section of the building (saving a lot of money on exploitation costs).

Fun side project:
- Prototyped an indoor navigation app for Android using iBeacons. Dijkstra-based routing, sensor fusion, proximity-triggered messaging managed by a Python backend.
