Analyzed data from 120 WiFi sensors in a large furniture store that also has a restaurant. Quantified how many people there are in an area at any time of the day, how long they stay in an area (dwell time), what their route was, whether they go shopping after having an inexpensive breakfast and how frequently they come back. 

Meanwhile, I'm also responsible for running the cluster and for the reliability of real-time sensor-based data acquisition on-site.
