Analyzed data from 120 WiFi sensors in a large furniture store that also has a restaurant. Quantified how many people there are in an area at any time in the day, how long they stay an area (dwell time), or in the entire store, what their route was, whether they go shopping after having an inexpensive breakfast and how frequently they come back. This fed into machine learning predictions for the following days to come.
