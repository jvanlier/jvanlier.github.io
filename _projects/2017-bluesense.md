BlueSense measures the behaviour of people within buildings, in real-time, using Wi-Fi sensors. It is able to parse many measurements per second, using horizontally scalable distributed computing (Kafka/Storm) and includes state of the art analytics to understand crowd density, crowd movement patterns, dwell times and occupancy levels, both descriptive and predictive. This system was deployed at various clients in retail, public transport, facility management and a football stadium.

I worked on all aspects of the system: initially mostly engineering to build the big data platform, and in the final year I transitioned into becoming responsible for analytics. Featured subprojects are listed separately (below).
