BlueSense measures the behaviour of people within buildings, in real-time, using Wi-Fi sensors. It includes state of the art analytics to understand crowd density, crowd movement patterns, dwell times and occupancy levels, both descriptive and predictive. This system was deployed at various clients in retail, public transport, facility management and a football stadium.

I worked on all aspects of the system: from engineering to science, from sensors to big data clusters. A couple featured subprojects are listed separately (below).
