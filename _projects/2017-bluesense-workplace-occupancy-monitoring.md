As we tried to find product-market fit with BlueSense, the product pivoted from retail to facility management for offices. Internally at KPMG, there was a desire for a better understanding of workplace utilization and occupancy, in order to more effciently allocate teams to areas, and possibly close down an entire section of the building, temporarily or permanently (saving money on rent and exploitation costs).
