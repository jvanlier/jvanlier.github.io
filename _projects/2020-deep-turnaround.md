Schiphol Amsterdam Airport is approaching the maximum of its operational capacity and is therefore looking for creative ways to improve operational efficiency and reduce delays. This sparked the "Deep Turnaround" project: an iniative to detect events during the aircraft turnaround process with deep learning-based computer vision techniques.

I built the initial prototype and evangalised it internally. The initial protype used object detection, Kalman filter tracking and Python-based event generation code. As the team grew, I transitioned into a hands-on Lead Data Scientist role and spearheaded the rewrite into a more maintainble end-to-end learning system using activity recognition convolutional neural nets that operate on sequences of images.
