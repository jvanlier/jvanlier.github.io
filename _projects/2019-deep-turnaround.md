Data Science lead for the Deep Turnaround project: an initiative to detect events during the aircraft handling process with deep learning-based computer vision techniques. Built the initial prototype with object detection, Kalman filter tracking and Python-based event generation code. Spearheaded the transition to end-to-end learning with activity recognition convolutional neural nets.
