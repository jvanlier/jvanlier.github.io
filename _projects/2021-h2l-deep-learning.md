H2L Robotics build robots that drive through tulips fields autonomously, while detecting and localizing sick tulips and applying a treatment.

I worked on the neural network that detects the tulips using cameras. That involved building tools around data processing (e.g. for annotations), writing Keras/TensorFlow code, performing a lot of experiments to figure out what works and what doesn't.
