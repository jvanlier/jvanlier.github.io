We build a robot that drives through tulips fields autonomously, while detecting and localizing sick tulips and applying treatments.

I work on the neural network that detects the tulips using cameras. That means building tools around data processing (e.g. for annotations), writing Keras/TensorFlow code, performing a lot of experiments to figure out what works and what doesn't.
