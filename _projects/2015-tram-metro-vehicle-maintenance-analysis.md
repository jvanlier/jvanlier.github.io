Public transport providers maintain expensive assets and malfunctions on the track can be quite disruptive to their travelers
and society as a whole. If maintenance can be done earlier (preventing breakdowns) or more efficiently, this can translate into many euros saved.

I investigated how patterns in vehicle (sensor) data relate to vehicle maintenance records. This uncovered interesting insights, such as specific areas of the rail that cause significantly more wheel damage.
