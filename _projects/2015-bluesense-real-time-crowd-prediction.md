A real-time monitor and short-term prediction (30 mins ahead) to demonstrate the capability of our product internally. Sensors monitored the KPMG restaurant anonymously and helped our colleagues avoid crowds and queues. Since KPMG folks have high hourly rates, I like to think the product paid for itself.
