I investigated how travelers can be assigned into several clusters based on traveler behavior. This allows the 
organization to better match its supply with the demand. I used Hive on a Hadoop cluster to calculate various 
indicators, applied the K-means clustering algorithm in Python, visualized the results with matplotlib and Gephi and 
drove the interpretation/validation of the results with the business stakeholders.
